 Q1: Which category of product has largest amount? 
 <br>
  Q2: select the Quantity and category where profit is highest?<br>
  Q3: Update the quantity of product by 2 where order Id is B-25687 ? <br>
  Q4: insert one more row where order Id = 9999, Amount= 550, profit= 50,
quantity= 8, category = clothing, sub-category= dupatta, payment mode= UPI? <br>
Q5: Remove the column from the sheet2$ where the column 
contain null value?<br>
Q6: Rename column name in the table ?<br>
Q7: shows the country name with the table one and join the
table 2 which contain the data of country?<br>
Q8: shows the Customer City name with the table one and
